<p>Despite South Africa's agricultural strength, many households in our rural communities, like Tshidimbini near Thohoyandou, still face severe hunger. This isn't just about a lack of food; it's about a lack of access to reliable, affordable, and nutritious food.

The root causes are complex and interconnected:

Poverty & Unemployment: Many families cannot afford consistently healthy food, especially as prices rise.

Climate Change: Unpredictable rainfall, prolonged droughts, and extreme temperatures disrupt traditional farming.

Soil Degradation: Years of erosion and nutrient depletion make it difficult to grow crops successfully.

Resource Limitations: A lack of funding, tools, seeds, and secure land prevents many from starting their own gardens.

Community garden projects offer a powerful, grassroots solution to these deep-seated challenges.</p>
