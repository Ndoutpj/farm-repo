                Welcome to the Thohoyandou Community Gardens Project. Our mission is simple: to fight food insecurity through the power of community and sustainable agriculture. Located in the Tshidimbini village, we are a collective of local residents, farmers, and volunteers working to ensure every household has access to fresh, nutritious food. We believe the solution to hunger lies not in handouts, but in empowermentâ€”providing the tools, training, and support for people to grow their own food and build self-sufficiency. This website showcases our work, our challenges, our successes, and how you can join us in cultivating a food-secure future for all.
